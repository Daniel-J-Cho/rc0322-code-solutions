          you need directly into your note, so you never have to leave it. And because
          Canvas learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every patient
          you see.

          technology to actually improve the quality of care I provide.”

          like a lot to ask and those are tremendously important questions. But

          day. Canvas automates quality protocols and charge capture so clinicians can
          focus on more complex work only they can do.

          “With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as complex as ever,
          to be honest I didn’t know how we were going to keep up. We’re a small
          practice and we don’t have a big quality team or a group of coders to
          catch everything. The automation in Canvas has completely eliminated my
          concerns around quality and revenue performance.”
